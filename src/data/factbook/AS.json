Demand for resources and energy from Asia and especially China has stalled and sharp drops in current prices have impacted growth. ++  ++ The services sector is the largest part of the Australian economy, accounting for about 70% of GDP and 75% of jobs. Australia was comparatively unaffected by the global financial crisis as the banking system has remained strong and inflation is under control. ++  ++ Australia benefited from a dramatic surge in its terms of trade in recent years, although this trend has reversed due to falling global commodity prices. Australia is a significant exporter of natural resources, energy, and food. Australia's abundant and diverse natural resources attract high levels of foreign investment and include extensive reserves of coal, iron, copper, gold, natural gas, uranium, and renewable energy sources. A series of major investments, such as the US$40 billion Gorgon Liquid Natural Gas project, will significantly expand the resources sector. ++  ++ Australia is an open market with minimal restrictions on imports of goods and services. The process of opening up has increased productivity, stimulated growth, and made the economy more flexible and dynamic. Australia plays an active role in the World Trade Organization, APEC, the G20, and other trade forums. Australia’s free trade agreement (FTA) with China entered into force in 2015, adding to existing FTAs with the Republic of Korea, Japan, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, and the US, and a regional FTA with ASEAN and New Zealand. Australia continues to negotiate bilateral agreements with India and Indonesia, as well as larger agreements with its Pacific neighbors and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, and an Asia-wide Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership that includes the ten ASEAN countries and China, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and India. Australia is also working on the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement with Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the US, and Vietnam.","gdp_power_parity":"$1.189 trillion (2016 est.) ++ $1.156 trillion (2015 est.) ++ $1.128 trillion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"2.9% (2016 est.) ++ 2.4% (2015 est.) ++ 2.7% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$48,800 (2016 est.) ++ $48,300 (2015 est.) ++ $47,800 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"58.5%","gdp_consumption":"18.7%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"24.3%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0%","gdp_exports":"19.4%","gdp_imports":"-20.9% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"3.6%","gdp_sector_industry":"28.2%","gdp_sector_services":"68.2% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"wheat, barley, sugarcane, fruits;
